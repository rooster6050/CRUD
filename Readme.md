Server - I chose wildfly because it is free and open-source, and runs on multiple platforms with java
Source-control - I used git because it is Distributed version control, which meant I could work from several locations with less risk
DB - I used hibernate as I had the most experience with this
JSON Converter- I used GSON as after using it previously and Jackson, I found it easier to use and more versatile
